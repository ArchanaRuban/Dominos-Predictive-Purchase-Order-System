## Skills Takeaway

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time Series Forecasting
- Predictive Modeling
- Business Decision Making
- Real-World Application of Data Science

## Domain

**Food Service Industry**

## Problem Statement

Dominos needs an optimized approach to order ingredients by predicting future sales and generating purchase orders. By forecasting sales accurately, Dominos can:

- Maintain optimal inventory levels.
- Reduce costs related to excess or expired stock.
- Improve business decision-making based on sales trends.
- Optimize the supply chain for efficiency.

## Business Use Cases

- **Inventory Management:** Maintain the right stock levels.
- **Cost Reduction:** Minimize waste and unnecessary expenditures.
- **Sales Forecasting:** Use predictive models to anticipate demand.
- **Supply Chain Optimization:** Ensure smooth and efficient ordering processes.

## Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Exploration

- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze sales trends, seasonality, and patterns. Use visualizations to identify key features.

### 2. Sales Prediction

- **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features like day of the week, month, promotional periods, and holidays.
- **Model Selection:** Choose an appropriate forecasting model (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, or Regression Model).
- **Model Training:** Train the model using historical sales data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Use Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to assess accuracy.

### 3. Purchase Order Generation

- **Sales Forecasting:** Predict pizza sales for the next week.
- **Ingredient Calculation:** Determine ingredient quantities required based on sales predictions and ingredient dataset.
- **Purchase Order Creation:** Generate a detailed order specifying required ingredient quantities.

## Results

- Accurate sales predictions.
- A comprehensive purchase order detailing required ingredients for the forecasted sales period.
